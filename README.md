## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 AI Replace Selection

Voice-controlled text editing — select text, speak instruction, get AI-transformed result.

- Select code → say "add error handling" → improved code replaces selection
- Select paragraph → say "make it shorter" → condensed version
- Empty field + "no selection" mode → say "write a greeting email" → generated text
- Works in any Windows application

**Setup:** Settings → Advanced → AI Replace Settings

### 📤 Send to ChatGPT/Claude

Voice-to-AI bridge via [AivoRelay Connector](https://github.com/MaxITService/AivoRelay-relay) browser extension.

| Mode                   | Input                  | What ChatGPT receives     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Voice only**         | Speak your question    | Your transcribed question |
| **Voice + Selection**  | Speak + selected text  | Question with context     |
| **Voice + Screenshot** | Speak + screen capture | Question with image       |

**Examples:**

- Say "what is recursion" → ChatGPT gets your question
- Select error log, say "why is this failing" → ChatGPT gets question + the log
- Capture chart, say "explain this" → ChatGPT gets question + screenshot

> ⚠️ **Requires:** [AivoRelay Connector](https://github.com/MaxITService/AivoRelay-relay) Chrome extension

### 🎚️ Transcription Profiles
