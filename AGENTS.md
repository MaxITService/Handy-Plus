# Fork Agents Guide

> **CRITICAL: WE ARE ON THE `Microsoft-store` BRANCH.**
> This branch is specifically for the Microsoft Store release.
> **AGENT RULE:** Always refer to this version as the **Microsoft Store Edition**.
> All updates must be compliant with Microsoft Store policies (e.g., no self-updating, sandboxed file access in mind (MSIX packaged, this will be handled atomatically later)). Warn the user in case something is not compatible with the Microsoft Store. 

> **Agent rule:** all debugging/build verification is done by the user (do not run automated tests/builds unless explicitly requested).
> This file provides guidance for AI code agents working with this fork.
> CODE ONLY WHEN APPROVED BY USER. Otherwise, only your thoughts in chat are needed.
> If you are not very sure that change will fix it, consult user first, user may want to revert unsuccessful fix, so user needs to commit and stuff.
> Never Commit!
> Start from writing instructions about building rules only in chat to user. Write them to user!!!!

## Environment:

Windows 11; PowerShell (pwsh) host.
Harness: use PowerShell with -NoProfile only: avoid profile interference.

**CRITICAL: Environment Setup**. This project requires Visual Studio 2022 build tools which are NOT in the path by default.

**Run Get-Dev ONCE per conversation** (not with every command). Run it as a standalone command first, then run cargo commands separately:

```powershell
# Step 1: Run this ONCE at the start of conversation (standalone command)
$vsPath = & "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vswhere.exe" -latest -products * -property installationPath; cmd /c "`"$vsPath\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat`" -arch=x64 && set" | Where-Object { $_ -match '^(.+?)=(.*)$' } | ForEach-Object { Set-Item "Env:$($Matches[1])" $Matches[2] }
```

After running Get-Dev once, cargo/rustc commands work for the rest of the conversation without needing to re-run it.

**CRITICAL: Concurrent Cargo Processes & Tooling**.

1. **Check for locks FIRST**: Use this exact snippet before running any Cargo/Tauri command:
   `Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Name -match "cargo|tauri|rustc|bun" } | Select-Object Name, Id`
2. **The "No-Go" Rule**: If ANY processes are found: **DO NOT run `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, or `cargo fmt`**.
   - _Why?_ `check`/`clippy` fail due to Windows file locks in `target`.
   - _Why `fmt`?_ Even though it doesn't touch `target`, it modifies source files which triggers the dev-server watcher to instantly recompile/restart the app, disrupting active testing.
3. **Safe to run anytime**: `tsc` (Type check), `eslint` (Linting), and `prettier` (Formatting) are safe to run even if the dev-server is active, as they operate only on frontend assets and don't trigger Rust re-compilation.
4. **Wait for completion**: If you start a background command, you MUST use `command_status` until it returns `Status: DONE`. Do not propose new commands while one is running.
5. **Get-Dev Once Per Conversation**: Run the environment setup command ONCE at the start. Do NOT inline it with every cargo command—this causes "input line too long" errors.
6. **Use Output Markers**: For long commands, wrap them in markers:
   `Write-Host "--- START TASK ---"; cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml; Write-Host "--- END TASK ---"`
7. **Tool Discretion**: Use these tools ONLY when needed for verification. They are NOT mandatory for every small change. Do not run them blindly if you are confident in your edits.

**Key Tools:**
| Tool | command | Purpose | Safe with Dev Server? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TSC** | `bun x tsc --noEmit` | Frontend Type Checking | ✅ YES |
| **ESLint** | `bun run lint` | Frontend Style/Logic Police | ✅ YES |
| **Prettier**| `bun run format` | Frontend Code Formatting | ✅ YES |
| **Cargo Fmt**| `cargo fmt` | Rust Code Formatting | ❌ NO (triggers re-build) |
| **Clippy** | `cargo clippy` | Rust "Smart" Linter | ❌ NO (file locks) |
| **Check** | `cargo check` | Rust Compilation Check | ❌ NO (file locks) |

**ast-grep (sg) and rg and also sd INSTALLED on Windows and on PATH, installed via Winget - their Windows versions!**
No need to use WSL for them: their Windows versions are installed: callable directly from PowerShell. Use the best tool, where sane, where the best tool wins, probably you also have good tools inside your harness.

## Fork-Specific Features

### 1. Remote STT API (Windows only)

- Files: `src-tauri/src/managers/remote_stt.rs`, `src/components/settings/remote-stt/`
- Uses OpenAI-compatible `/audio/transcriptions` endpoint
- API keys stored in Windows Credential Manager via `keyring` crate

**Note:** On Windows, **all LLM API keys** (Remote STT, Post-Processing, AI Replace) are stored securely in the Windows Credential Manager via `src-tauri/src/secure_keys.rs`. Existing keys from JSON settings are auto-migrated on first launch.

#### Status & Flow

| State          | Display      | Description                              |
| :------------- | :----------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `recording`    | Red pulsing  | User is recording audio                  |
| `transcribing` | Blue pulsing | Audio sent to API, waiting for response  |
| `error`        | Red text     | API error occurred (auto-hides after 3s) |

- **Errors**: Categorized (TLS, Network, Server, Parse, etc.).
- **Logic**: Stop recording → `transcribing` state → API call → Success (paste) OR Error (show categorization + emit `remote-stt-error` event).

**Implementation files:**

- `src-tauri/src/plus_overlay_state.rs` — Error categorization and overlay control
- `src/overlay/plus_overlay_states.ts` — TypeScript types and display text
- `src/overlay/RecordingOverlay.tsx` — Overlay UI (modified to handle extended states)

### 2. AI Replace Selection (Windows only)

- Files: `src-tauri/src/actions.rs` (AiReplaceSelectionAction), `src/components/settings/ai-replace/`
- Captures selected text, sends to LLM with voice instruction, replaces selection
- Selection capture uses Windows-specific APIs in `src-tauri/src/input.rs`
- **Optional separate LLM configuration**: Configure a different provider/model specifically for AI Replace in "LLM API Relay" settings. Falls back to post-processing defaults.

### 3. Connector (Send Transcription to Extension)

- Primary implementation: `src-tauri/src/managers/connector.rs` (local HTTP server), `src-tauri/src/actions.rs` (Send\*ToExtension actions), `src/components/settings/browser-connector/`
- Extension polls AivoRelay's local server (default `http://127.0.0.1:38243`):
  - `GET /messages?since=<cursor>` → queued messages + next `cursor`
  - `GET /blob/{attId}` → attachment bytes (short-lived)
  - `POST /messages` → extension acks (e.g. `keepalive_ack`, `password_ack`)
- **Auth required:** `Authorization: Bearer <connector_password>` (see `src-tauri/src/settings.rs`; password may rotate via `passwordUpdate` handshake)

### 4. Send Transcription + Screenshot to Extension (Windows only)

- Files: `src-tauri/src/actions.rs` (SendScreenshotToExtensionAction), `src-tauri/src/managers/connector.rs` (blob serving), `src-tauri/src/region_capture.rs`
- **Default**: Uses **Native Region Capture** (Windows only) - draws a selection overlay directly on screen.
- **Alternative**: Can use external tools like ShareX (configure in settings).
- Watches screenshot folder for new images using `notify` crate (if using external tool)
- Sends bundle message with image attachment and voice instruction to extension
- Configurable: capture command, folder path, timeout, "require recent" filter, "allow without voice"
- Settings: `screenshot_capture_method`, `screenshot_capture_command`, `screenshot_folder`, etc.

### 5. Transcription Profiles

- Files: `src-tauri/src/settings.rs` (TranscriptionProfile struct), `src-tauri/src/shortcut.rs` (profile commands), `src/components/settings/TranscriptionProfiles.tsx`
- Create custom shortcuts with specific language, translation, and system prompt settings
- Each profile creates a dynamic shortcut binding (e.g., `transcribe_profile_1234567890`)
- Profile's `system_prompt` overrides global per-model prompt when set
- **System Prompt Limits**: Enforced based on active STT model (Whisper: 896 chars, Deepgram: 2000 chars)
- Character limit logic shared between `TranscriptionSystemPrompt.tsx` (frontend) and `managers/remote_stt.rs` (backend)

### 6. Voice Command Center (Windows only)

- Files: `src-tauri/src/commands/voice_command.rs`, `src/components/settings/voice-commands/`
- Execute PowerShell scripts via voice commands (e.g., "lock computer", "open notepad")
- **Safe Execution**: Always shows a confirmation overlay before running any command
- **LLM Fallback**: If no predefined command matches, uses an LLM to generate a PowerShell one-liner on the fly
- **Modes**: Predefined (fast, offline) vs. LLM (flexible, requires API key)

### 7. Transcribe Audio File

- Files: `src-tauri/src/commands/file_transcription.rs`, `src/components/settings/transcribe-file/`
- Drag-and-drop interface for transcribing existing audio files
- Supports `wav`, `mp3`, `m4a`, `ogg`, `flac`, `webm`
- **Output Formats**: Plain Text, SRT (Subtitles), VTT (Web Video Text Tracks)
- **Timestamping**: Accurate timestamps are available when using **Local Whisper** models
- **Remote STT**: Currently produces text-only output (no segment timestamps)

### 8. Text Replacement

- Files: `src-tauri/src/settings.rs` (TextReplacement struct), `src/components/settings/text-replacement/`
- Automatic find-and-replace for transcription output
- **Escape Sequences**: Supports `\n` (LF), `\r\n` (CRLF), `\r` (CR), `\t` (tab), `\\` (backslash)
- **Options per rule**:
  - `case_sensitive` — case-sensitive or case-insensitive matching (default: true)
  - `is_regex` — treat "from" pattern as regular expression (supports `$1`, `$2` capture groups)
- Applied after all processing (Chinese conversion, LLM post-processing)
- Each rule can be individually enabled/disabled
- **Use Cases**: Fix commonly misheard words, apply formatting, normalize punctuation, remove repeated words

## Guidelines for Agents

### When Modifying Fork Features

1. Check [`code-notes.md`](code-notes.md) to understand which files are fork-specific
2. Fork features are mostly Windows-only — use `#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]` guards
3. Settings are in `src-tauri/src/settings.rs` (look for `remote_stt`, `ai_replace_*`, `connector_*` fields)

### Adding New Fork Features

1. Add new files when possible (cleaner separation from upstream) ! So original code "is left alone" and can be merged easily, but we have like copy, which is fully custom: less code to merge.
2. Document in `code-notes.md`
3. Add translations in `src/i18n/locales/en/translation.json`
4. Consider platform guards if Windows-specific

## Upstream Sync / Merging

See [`fork-merge-guide.md`](fork-merge-guide.md) for upstream tracking and the merge/conflict-resolution checklist.
